# Documentation

This site documents how to install, configure, and use Markspresso.

## Getting started

See the home page for a quick install and setup guide. Once you have a site scaffolded, you can organize your documentation using Markspresso's navigation system.

## Navigation overview

Markspresso automatically generates navigation from your content directory structure using a numeric prefix convention.

- Use zero-padded numeric prefixes on files and folders to control ordering (e.g. `010_`, `020_`).
- Keep your docs in a shallow hierarchy (typically two levels).
- Derive readable titles from filenames, or override with front matter `title:`.

For details, see the "Navigation" page in this site.
